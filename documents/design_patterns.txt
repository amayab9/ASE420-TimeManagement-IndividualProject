Command Pattern:
The command pattern is shown in the 'Command' abstract class and its concrete implementations ('RecordCommand',
'QueryCommand', 'ReportCommand', 'PriorityCommand').

Strategy Pattern:
The 'process_command' method in 'TimeManagementTool' demonstrates the strategy pattern by delegating the
execution of a command to its respective 'execute' method in the concrete command objects.

Dependency Injection:
By passing the 'database' object to the 'TimeManagementTool' constructor, it is evident dependency injection
is being used.

Singleton Pattern:
The 'Database' class is a form of singleton as it manages the connection to the SQLite database. Only one
instance of the 'Database' class is needed.
