As a student, I want to generate a report of activities.

    - As a user, I want to type “report yyyy/mm/dd today’ as an input to the application so I can get all activities done between a specified date and today's date.
    - As a user, I want to type “report yyyy/mm/dd yyyy/mm/dd’ as an input to the application so I can get all activities done between the first specified date and the second date.

As a student, I want to generate a report of my frequent activities.

    - As a user, I want to type “priority’ as an input to view my most frequently done activites with their occurences.
