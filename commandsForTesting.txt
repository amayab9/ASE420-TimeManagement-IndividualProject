priority


****priority should probably pull up a list of tasks in order from most done to least done


Justification:
programV2,
requirement: ; “query ‘Java’ ” to get all the Java-related activities
-the user should type one word bc he wants to pull all related activities, user shouldn't type unnecessary amount of info
when querying.

requirement: I can specify the date using the 2022/09/23 form and add AM or PM to the FROM or TO
- the user should add AM or PM to the end of the time without a space because in a command line it is unnecessary
to add the space between the time and the time of day

requirement: the priority command gives me the list of activities I spend most of my time on.
- since we do not know how many activities the user will input in total, and instead of printing out all instances of the activity,
'priority' prints out the top 10 most done activities with the count of how many each is done and the instances
