Justification:
programV2,
requirement: ; “query ‘Java’ ” to get all the Java-related activities
-the user should type one word bc he wants to pull all related activities, user shouldn't type unnecessary amount of info
when querying.

requirement: I can specify
the date using the 2022/09/23 form and add AM or PM to the FROM or TO
- the user should add AM or PM to the end of the time without a space because in a command line it is unnecessary
to add the space between the time and the time of day
